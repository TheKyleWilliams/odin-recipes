            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.            </li>
