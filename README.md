# odin-recipes
For this project I'm creating a basic recipe websie. This will be a multi-page 
project that consists of an index page and several recipe pages.

The point of this project is to showcase the basic HTML I learned so far in 
The Odin Project. Also, the project will force me commit several times before
actually pushing to GitHub. This will give me exposure to the Git workflow.
